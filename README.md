Roman Numerals Kata
---
Given a positive integer number (eg 42) determine
its Roman numeral representation as a String (eg "XLII").

You cannot write numerals like IM for 999.
Wikipedia states "Modern Roman numerals are written by
expressing each digit separately starting with the
leftmost digit and skipping any digit with a value of zero."

Examples:

1 ->    "I" | 10 ->    "X" | 100 ->    "C" | 1000 ->    "M"
2 ->   "II" | 20 ->   "XX" | 200 ->   "CC" | 2000 ->   "MM"
3 ->  "III" | 30 ->  "XXX" | 300 ->  "CCC" | 3000 ->  "MMM"
4 ->   "IV" | 40 ->   "XL" | 400 ->   "CD" | 4000 -> "MMMM"
5 ->    "V" | 50 ->    "L" | 500 ->    "D" |
6 ->   "VI" | 60 ->   "LX" | 600 ->   "DC" |
7 ->  "VII" | 70 ->  "LXX" | 700 ->  "DCC" |
8 -> "VIII" | 80 -> "LXXX" | 800 -> "DCCC" |
9 ->   "IX" | 90 ->   "XC" | 900 ->   "CM" |

Anagrams

Write a program to generate all potential 
anagrams of an input string.

For example, the potential anagrams of "biro" are

biro bior brio broi boir bori
ibro ibor irbo irob iobr iorb
rbio rboi ribo riob roib robi
obir obri oibr oirb orbi orib
